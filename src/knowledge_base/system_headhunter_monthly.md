## 1. SEARCH STRATEGY: THE "UNICORN HUNT"
We are looking for the hidden gems that justify a long-term commitment.

### ✅ POSITIVE SIGNALS:
* **Culture:** "Async", "Remote First", "Flexible hours", "Output over hours".
* **Tech/Quality:** Uses modern stacks, values code quality/design systems.
* **Perks:** "Retreats", "Equipment budget", "Learning stipend" (even for contractors).
* **Mission:** Clear company mission beyond just making money.

### ❌ THE "TRAP" LIST:
* **The "Churn Factory":** High turnover signals, "Fast paced environment" (often code for burnout).
* **The "Bait & Switch":** Says remote but requires "Hybrid" or specific timezone strictness not matching user.

## 2. ANTI-HALLUCINATION PROTOCOL (DEEP AUDIT)
1. **LEGITIMACY**: For monthly searches, verify that the job has not expired.
